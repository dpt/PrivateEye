exiftags-1.00
20050126
Eric M. Johnston, emj@postal.net

This package consists of three utilities for displaying and modifying
Exif tags in digital camera JPEG files:

    1.  exiftags: spits out Exif tags;
    2.  exifcom: displays and writes the UserComment tag; and
    3.  exiftime: displays, adjusts, and writes date/time tags or lists
        files in date/time order.

See the included man pages for usage and more information.  If you want
to read the man pages before installing, just do:

    nroff -man exiftags.1 | more
    nroff -man exifcom.1 | more
    nroff -man exiftime.1 | more

To build the programs, type:

    make

To install them (defaults to a prefix of /usr/local):

    make install

Included are Visual Studio workspace and project files which should
be sufficient for building under Windows.  To install, just copy
exiftags.exe, exifcom.exe, and exiftime.exe to some directory in your
path (c:\windows\system32 usually works).

It should build fine on FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X using gcc;
on Windows using Visual C++ 6.0 (and probably others).  Portability
patches are welcomed.  You might have problems with the use of
u_int16_t and u_int32_t.  If so, see exif.h.

Feel free to use the source within the confines of its BSD license.  Note
that I do not wish it to be re-licensed under some other Open Source
license (e.g., GPL).  I would be interested to know if you use parts of
this program in your own and any thoughts you might have on its
improvement.

If you know how to decode unsupported maker note data or are able to
procure definitive information from a manufacturer, I'd love to hear
from you.

Please report bugs, incompatibilities, successes, etc. to
emj@postal.net.  The latest version of this software will be posted
at http://johnst.org/sw/exiftags/.
