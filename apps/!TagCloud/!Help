TagCloud
========

Test application to prove that tag clouds work outside of PrivateEye.

Notes on this version:

- List mode does not work (not yet implemented)
- Data is random
- Dropping files on tags is known about but not hooked up to anything
- Window doesn't resize when toolbar is toggled on/off
- Window doesn't resize when the content becomes shorter
- No font size etc. config is exposed (though PrivateEye has it)
