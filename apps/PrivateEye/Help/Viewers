#Subpage Loading
Loading Images
To view an image, drag it from a directory display to the icon bar icon. You can load any number of images, each will be shown in its own viewer window.

To re-use an existing viewer window drag the image into that viewer window.

If the image does not have the correct file type, then PrivateEye will attempt to identify the correct type and set it.
#Subpage Focus
Input Focus
When you click in a viewer window it gains the input focus. You can then use the keys detailed below HYPERLINK to scroll, scale, etc.
#Subpage Scrolling
Scrolling Around
If parts of the image are not visible, you can scroll around either by dragging within the window using SELECTôthe /grab/ toolôor by using the cursor keys.

On suitable OS versions, the mouse scroll wheel may also be used to scroll vertically.

You can scroll to a specific point by holding CTRL and clicking SELECT at the desired position.
#Subpage Scaling
Scaling the View
You may need to scale the image to fit it to the screen, or to view an area in detail. There are a number of controls for this.

The /Scale view/ dialogue is available from the viewer menu or by pressing F11. The default scale of 100% shows the image at a 1:1 pixel ratio.

#Spritefile Sprites
#Sprite c,f scalewin

There are standard preset scales of 25%, 50%, 100% and 200%. *FIT SCREEN* fits the view to the size of the screen. *FIT WINDOW* fits the image to the current size of the viewer window. Click *SCALE* to make the scale level take effect.

With the Scale view dialogue open, you can also use the UP and DOWN keys to change the scale by 5%. This takes immediate effect. Using SHIFT in conjunction doubles the step size to 10%. (PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN perform the same function.)

{fH5}Scaling with the Keyboard{f}

CTRL W and CTRL Q zoom in and zoom out respectively. CTRL T toggles between the previously selected and the current scale level. CTRL D resets the scale to 100%.

{fH5}Scaling with the Mouse{f}

A SHIFT SELECT click will zoom in around the clicked point. SHIFT ADJUST click does the same but zooms out. If multiple steps are configured then a zoom effect will be used.

Dragging ADJUST in the viewer window drags out a zoom box. The area of the image highlighted will be scaled to fit the window.

#Subpage Moving
Moving Between Files
Pressing SPACE, or alternatively PAGE DOWN, will move the viewer onto the next file in the directory. PAGE UP moves to the previous file.

The order of the files in the directory determines the previous / next viewed image.
#Subpage Saving
Saving
F3 opens the /Save/ dialogue. This saves a copy of the display image.
#Subpage Delete
Delete
CTRL K deletes the currently viewed image. It uses the multitasking Filer_Action window to perform the deletion so will interface with /Recyclone/, etc.
#Subpage Views
New views
Should you need to view an image at two different scales, or view multiple different parts of a single large image, you can create a new view by pressing CTRL N. This opens up a new view of the same image.

Additional views require no significant additional memory.
#Subpage Embedding
Embedding
Dragging with SHIFT CTRL SELECT inside the viewer window allows you to embed the viewer window inside another window.

To un-embed a window perform the same action again but release the drag when over the icon bar.

This uses a feature of the Nested Wimp intended for embedding Java plugins inside web browser windows.
