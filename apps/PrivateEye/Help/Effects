Effects
#Parent !Root
The Effects window lets you apply a multitude of effects to bitmap images.

The Effects window is only available for 32bpp colour bitmap formats. If you want to use this feature with a JPEG then first *CONVERT TO SPRITE*.

Open the Effects window by choosing {*}EFFECTS...{*} from the viewer window's menu or by pressing CTRL E. An effects dialogue will appear containing an empty list:

#Spritefile Sprites
#Sprite c,f effectswin

#Subpage Adding
Adding Effects
Click ADD to start adding effects. The effects palette window will pop up:

#Spritefile Sprites
#Sprite c,f effectspal

Drag and drop an effect from the effects palette to the effects window to add it. The viewer window will immediately update with a preview of the effect. The overall level of the effect is controlled with the slider at the bottom of the window. Dragging the slider updates the preview.

Click *APPLY* to make the effect permanent.

{fH5}Multiple Effects{f}

You can add multiple effects at once. Multiple effects are applied in sequence from top-to-bottom. The result is then blended with the original image.
#Subpage Slider
Level Slider
Effects are computed and blended against the original image. The level slider controls the amount of blending.

#Spritefile Sprites
#Sprite c,f slider

Rather than ranging from 0% (original image) to 100% (processed image) it ranges -100%..200%. This is because the blender is extrapolative: it can produce results outside the normal range.

Setting the level outside the 0..100% range causes extrapolative results. For example, adding a "clear to black" effect then applying a level of -100% causes the image to be brightened.
#Subpage Editing
Editing Effects
The effects are shown in a scrolling list. Effects can be selected with SELECT and de-selected with ADJUST.

The {*}EDIT...{*} and *DELETE* buttons beneath the list will highlight when the respective actions are available.

To delete the currently selected effect, click *DELETE* or press the DELETE key.

{fh4}Re-ordering Effects{f}

The ordering of effects can be significant: drag and drop effects to re-order them. While you drag the effect a light grey indicator line will show you the position where the effect will be inserted.

#Spritefile Sprites
#Sprite c,f effectsdrag
#Subpage Clear
Effect: Clear
Simply clears the image to the specified colour.

Clicking the {*}EDIT...{*} button will open up a RISC OS standard ColourPicker dialogue.

The Clear effect is only of use by itself, as any further effects added later in the list will be applied to a plain colour.
#Subpage Curve
Effect: Curve
The Curve effect offers a combined control for gamma, brightness, contrast, midpoint, bias and gain adjustment. You can also invert the curve (flip it left-to-right) and reflect it around its middle.

Clicking the {*}EDIT...{*} button will open up the Curve effect dialogue. By default it shows a linear mapping (no change):

#Spritefile Sprites
#Sprite c,f effectscrv

Choose the channel to edit from the radio buttons on the top right hand side, then drag the sliders to adjust the curve.

Click RESET if you want the default settings back.
#Subpage Greyscale
Effect: Greyscale
The Greyscale effect discards all chroma information leaving only the luma present.

As with the histogram, this uses the Rec. 601 weightings.
#Subpage Blur
Effect: Blur
The Blur effect offers a choice of either a box blur or a gaussian blur. Both can specify a radius of up to 47 pixels.

Clicking the {*}EDIT...{*} button will open up the Blur effect dialogue:

#Spritefile Sprites
#Sprite c,f effectsblr

Note that using box blur with large radii can result in visible banding.
#Subpage Sharpen
Effect: Sharpen
The Sharpen effect provides a mild sharpening effect, using a 3x3 convolution matrix.
#Subpage Expand
Effect: Expand dynamic range
This effect looks for unused space in the shadows and highlights of the histogram and stretches the image to occupy all of the available volume.

The RGB channels are stretched by the same amount so this will preserve colours.
#Subpage Equalise
Effect: Histogram equalisation
Attempts to create an even spread of values across the available colour volume.

This is useful for extracting obscured detail from images, but processes RGB separately so can lead to colour distortion.
#Subpage Examples
Examples
{fH4}Changing brightness{f}

Add a Clear effect. Set it to black. Dragging the slider to the left will increase the image's brightness.

#Spritefile EffectsSpr
#Sprite c,f clear

{fH4}Changing contrast{f}

Add a Clear effect. Set its colour to 50% grey. Dragging the slider to the left will increase contrast; to the right will decrease contrast.

#Sprite c,f cont

{fH4}Changing saturation{f}

Add a Greyscale effect. Dragging the slider to the left will increase saturation; to the right will decrease saturation.

#Sprite c,f grey

{fH4}Sharpening an image{f}

Add a Blur effect (yes, really!) then drag the slider to the left past the left-most "notch".

Sharpening this way is sometimes called unsharp mask.

#Sprite c,f sharp

{fH4}Combined saturation and sharpening{f}

Add a Blur effect then a Greyscale effect. Dragging the slider to the left will simultaneously increase saturation and sharpen; to the right will decrease saturation and blur.

#Sprite c,f comb
#Subpage Memory
Memory Use & Speed
The effects system creates two temporary bitmaps of the same size as the original image. Therefore applying effects to large images will claim a lot of memory.

Similarly large images can also take some time to process. The full image is always processed. The update after dragging the effect level slider may not always be instant.
