Metadata
#Parent !Root
Some image files may contain embedded information additional to the image data. PrivateEye calls this /metadata/. The Metadata window lets you see this information.

{/}The Metadata window is presently only available for JPEG images loaded in their native format. If you want to use this feature you may need to disable *CONVERT TO SPRITE* in the JPEG choices.{/}

Open the Metadata window by choosing *METADATA* from the viewer window's menu or by pressing SHIFT CTRL F1. One metadata window may be opened for each image.

The menu entry will be greyed out if no metadata is present.

The metadata is presented in a tree format like this:

#Spritefile Sprites
#Sprite c,f metadata

Individual branches of the tree can be collapsed or expanded to hide or reveal relevant data by clicking the controls at the left.

Click MENU to open up a small menu which lets you collapse or expand all tree branches.

Classes of Metadata
There are three common types of JPEG metadata which PrivateEye understands:

è	Contains information including time, date, camera make, model, resolution, focus and flash.

{fH5}Adobe{f}
