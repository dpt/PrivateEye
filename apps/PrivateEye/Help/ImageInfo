Image Information
#Parent !Root
PrivateEye has *two* image information windows.

/Image Info/ shows information about the display image. It is available from the viewer menu, or with SHIFT F1, and looks like this:

#Spritefile Sprites
#Sprite c,f infowin

/Source Info/ shows information about the source image. It is available from the viewer menu, or with CTRL F1, and looks like this:

#Sprite c,f sourcewin

The information windows often display the same or similar information. However, if a change to the size of the image was made, e.g. a rotation, or a change in the image was required upon loading, e.g. converting from JPEG to Sprite, then the information may differ. For example, Sprite files appear to be 4 bytes longer when loaded than when on disc. This is because the in-memory structure of a sprite *is* 4 bytes longer.

Notice that source info window has additional DATE and FORMAT fields. Some formats (presently only JPEG) will fill out the FORMAT field with details of the structure of the image.

Many of the entries don't apply to vector formats so in those cases it will simply display a dash.
