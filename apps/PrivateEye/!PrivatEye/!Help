Recent Changes
--------------

### 3.10 (12 Sep 2021)

- Progressive JPEGs are now passed straight through to the OS when it is
  capable of decoding them. This requires RISC OS Select with SpriteExtend
  1.30 or RISC OS 5 with SpriteExtend 1.73, or later.

  You can still force JPEG cleaning on from the choices if you wish.

- The information given on JPEGs is enhanced. The source info window will
  show the details of the file format, being JFIF, Exif, Adobe or a
  combination thereof; Baseline, Extended Sequential or Progressive DCT
  coding and whether the packing was Huffman or Arithmetic.
  
- Hand-in-hand with the above is enhanced colourspace reporting. The
  "Colours" field will show whether the JPEG is encoded as YCbCr (the most
  common), YCCK (like CMYK), RGB or CMYK. It will report the number of
  components used, and the depth of those components too.

- Multiple effect windows may now be open concurrently.

- PrivateEye is now cross-compiled using GCCSDK.

### 3.01 (19 Jan 2018)

- Made the image stepping routine (PageUp/PageDown) cope with filesystems
  which don't return predictable context values.
