Please consult the manual for full information.

Changes in 3.10
---------------

- PrivateEye now passes progressive JPEGs straight through to the OS when the
  OS is capable of decoding them. This requires RISC OS Select with
  SpriteExtend 1.30 or RISC OS 5 with SpriteExtend 1.73, or later.

- Information on JPEGs is enhanced. The source info window will show the
  details of the file format, being JFIF, Exif, Adobe or a combination
  thereof; Baseline, Extended Sequential or Progressive, and whether the
  packing was Huffman or Arithmetic.
  
- Hand-in-hand with the above is enhanced colourspace reporting. The "Colours"
  field will show whether the JPEG is encoded as YCbCr (the most common),
  YCCK (CMYK-like), RGB or CMYK. It will report the number of components
  used, and the depth of those components.

- Multiple effect windows may now be open concurrently.

- PrivateEye is now cross-compiled using GCCSDK.
