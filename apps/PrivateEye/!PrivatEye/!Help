Recent Changes
--------------

### 3.14 (19 Aug 2022)

- When loading new images the "Fit to screen" mode will now only ever shrink
  images. This is more helpful than the previous behaviour which would scale
  small images up to enormous proportions. Note that the "Fit screen" button on
  the scale view dialogue is unaffected.
- The data transfer system has had an upgrade:
  - `<Wimp$Scrap>` won't appear in title bars now. It'll use `<untitled>` in
    title bars, and `ImageFile` when saving an image with no known name.
    Received files are marked as modified too. This matches the behaviour of
    standard RISC OS apps.
  - Message_DataOpen template mode (est_size == -2) is supported (it's not
    super useful because PrivateEye's not a full editor, but it is in there).
- libpng has been upgraded to 1.6.37.
- Fix: The GIF loader would crash if fed bad data.
- Fix: The PNG loader had memory leaks on the failure path.
- Fix: The rotate window thumbnail could have excessive black borders. I've
  made a small effort to make the scaling more accurate but note that, if
  enabled, Tinct has accuracy issues when downscaling that do cause a black
  border.
- Fix: When you adjust click to close a modified viewer window, the directory
  display that's opened will now pop up only after the viewer is gone rather
  than obscuring the discard/cancel/save dialogue.
- Fix: The effects window scroll list selection highlight now moves along with
  the dragged item.
- Fix: The expand dynamic range effect no longer crashes when there's only two
  colours in the image.

### 3.10 (12 Sep 2021)

- Progressive JPEGs are now passed straight through to the OS when it is
  capable of decoding them. This requires RISC OS Select with SpriteExtend
  1.30 or RISC OS 5 with SpriteExtend 1.73, or later.

  You can still force JPEG cleaning on from the choices if you wish.

- The information given on JPEGs is enhanced. The source info window will
  show the details of the file format, being JFIF, Exif, Adobe or a
  combination thereof; Baseline, Extended Sequential or Progressive DCT
  coding and whether the packing was Huffman or Arithmetic.
  
- Hand-in-hand with the above is enhanced colourspace reporting. The
  "Colours" field will show whether the JPEG is encoded as YCbCr (the most
  common), YCCK (like CMYK), RGB or CMYK. It will report the number of
  components used, and the depth of those components too.

- Multiple effect windows may now be open concurrently.

- PrivateEye is now cross-compiled using GCCSDK.

### 3.01 (19 Jan 2018)

- Made the image stepping routine (PageUp/PageDown) cope with filesystems
  which don't return predictable context values.
